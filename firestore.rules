/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SnakeWolf website.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows public read access to news articles, tags, and media items,
 * while requiring authentication for creating contact form submissions.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /news_articles/{newsArticleId}: Stores news articles. Publicly readable.
 * - /tags/{tagId}: Stores tags for news articles. Publicly readable.
 * - /contact_form_submissions/{contactFormSubmissionId}: Stores contact form submissions. Authentication required for create.
 * - /media_items/{mediaItemId}: Stores media items. Publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access for news articles, tags, and media items.
 * - Authentication is required to submit contact forms.
 * - No user ownership or roles are defined in the data model.
 * - Denormalization is not used because there are no ownership checks or role-based access control.
