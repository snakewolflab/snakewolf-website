/**
 * @file Overview
 * This ruleset enforces a public read-only model for all data. Any user can read all news articles, work items and creator items.
 * Write access is forbidden to all clients.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - All data resides in top-level collections: /news_articles, /work_items, and /creator_items.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: All collections are publicly readable via `get` and `list`.
 * - No Client Writes: All write operations (create, update, delete) are denied to prevent unauthorized data modification.
